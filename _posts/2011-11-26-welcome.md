I recently decided that it would be a _good thing_ to start a blog, mostly to force myself to have more of a presence online and to make me work on my writing skills. Naturally, after such a decision, one is led to the question: "What do I blog about?" Indeed, most people I've mentioned this to have asked the very same question of me. Until this point, I haven't been able to give a very good answer.

The topic emerged over lunch the other day, and one of my coworkers made a suggestion: "People tend to think they never do anything noteworthy, but that's not true. You're probably doing something noteworthy every day." It is very easy to fall into this way of thinking; after all, if _I_ can solve a problem, then clearly it is not that difficult to solve, so why would anyone else want to hear about it? Especially in software, how many times have you [googled a stacktrace](http://xkcd.com/979/) or an error message and gotten an answer from a blog post? Or at least a shove in the right direction?

My goal for this blog is to document problems I run into, in addition to whatever else I find interesting at the moment.
