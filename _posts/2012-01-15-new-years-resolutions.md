title: New Year's Resolutions
---
I generally don't buy into new year's resolutions; they seem to be an excuse for me to pretend that I'm going to change something suddenly and dramatically in my life. A couple months later, nothing has changed, because I tend to choose an unreachable goal

With that in mind this year I am making a resolution. This year, I resolve to finish projects. That's it. Not too much more than I already do - starting projects and working on them a bunch - but I'm going to focus on accomplishing the last 10%-15% and actually completing what I start.

To enforce that, any projects I start work on are going to be listed on the [projects]('/projects.html') page, for the whole world to see.
