title: Getting started developing open source software
---
While I've been programming in general for a long time (I have over a decade of "experience" under my belt at this point), only in the last year or so have I actually had to work on the same code as other people. I've come to realize that writing clean, DRY code, that is easy for others to understand, alongside the ability to read and _comprehend_ code that others have worked on is a skill in and of itself that needs work. Working on open source projects seems to be a great way to practice that skill. In the next couple of posts, I'm going to walk through the beginning of my exploration of the open source world.

#### Step 1: Choosing a project

How do you find the right project to contribute to? Look for something that you would (ideally, you _do_) use, or software for working with something that interests you. I have three broad interest categories I'm going to explore: Games, Music, and Education. Ideally, though, you can work on something that you are very familiar with, which you have used regularly.

If you know much about me, you know that I'm very interested in games and game design. For this reason, I'm looking at [Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup](http://crawl.develz.org/) as a potential project. I _love_ crawl - it will definitely get it's own design tour, and it would be really cool to help develop a big name game in the _indie_/_roguelike_ genre. Although I'm not familiar with the code (I'm only taking my very first look at it, now), a quick look at the issue tracker shows that I'll be able to at least understand what the problems are, right away, if not exactly how to fix it. The game is written in C++, which I am familiar with but have never used in a team; hopefully that won't be too prohibitive.

My plan, then, is to try to fix a couple of tickets for crawl in the next couple of weeks. As I'm just getting started, I'll be looking for low hanging fruit (probably low priority tickets) and using those to get more of a sense of how the code is structured. I'll keep you all posted on how it goes!
