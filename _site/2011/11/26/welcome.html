        <h3>Blogging</h3>
        <p>I recently decided that it would be a <em>good thing</em> to start a blog, mostly to force myself to have more of a presence online and to make me work on my writing skills. Naturally, after such a decision, one is led to the question: &#8220;What do I blog about?&#8221; Indeed, most people I&#8217;ve mentioned this to have asked the very same question of me. Until this point, I haven&#8217;t been able to give a very good answer.</p>

<p>The topic emerged over lunch the other day, and one of my coworkers made a suggestion: &#8220;People tend to think they never do anything noteworthy, but that&#8217;s not true. You&#8217;re probably doing something noteworthy every day.&#8221; It is very easy to fall into this way of thinking; after all, if <em>I</em> can solve a problem, then clearly it is not that difficult to solve, so why would anyone else want to hear about it? Especially in software, how many times have you <a href='http://xkcd.com/979/'>googled a stacktrace</a> or an error message and gotten an answer from a blog post? Or at least a shove in the right direction?</p>

<p>My goal for this blog is to document problems I run into, in addition to whatever else I find interesting at the moment.</p>
