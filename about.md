### About

My name is _Danny Spencer_, and I am a software developer in _San Fransico_. Things I enjoy and thus plan on writing about: _programming/technology_, _board and or video games_, _music_ and most importantly _whatever strikes my fancy at that moment_. I do hope that you enjoy your time here.

I do my very best to be rad whenever possible.
