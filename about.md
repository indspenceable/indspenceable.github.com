### About

My name is Danny Spencer, and I am a software developer in San Fransico. Things I enjoy and thus plan on writing about: programming/technology, board and or video games, music and most importantly _whatever strikes my fancy at that moment_. I hope that you enjoy your time here.

I do my very best to be rad whenever possible.
