title: Grocerly - A grocery tracker app
---
This last week at work has been a hackweek, and I've been tackling a small (but persistant) issue: tracking what groceries we should buy. Working with one of our interns, we've created Grocerly.

Over the course of a week (or, whatever timeframe you choose), users will get a number of votes to spend on any items they want. They'll be able to search from a list of items that have been submitted, or add their own item to the list. Once they've spent their votes for a week, they can go back and change them at any point. They can also choose to lock in their vote, so that each new week they'll spend their votes the same way.

When building Grocerly, we made care to make it generic enough to be used for different purposes.Roommates could use it to arrange groceries, or a club could use it to plan what events it wanted to do, or a band could use it to figure out what songs they wanted to play. At work, we're planning on using one instance for managing groceries, and one for managing tasks for our monthly code cleanup days.
